# 🍏 macOS IT Support & Security Labs – CBP OIT Prep

**Author:** [Kamal Bush](https://github.com/kbush2)  
**Focus Area:** macOS Administration · Endpoint Hardening · Automation · Incident Response  
**Goal:** Hands-on, evidence-based portfolio aligned with **DHS CBP OIT IT Support / Cyber Analyst** competencies.

---

## 🧩 Overview
Practical labs covering:
- macOS system auditing and inventory  
- Secure baseline configuration (FileVault, Firewall, Gatekeeper)  
- Logging & telemetry (`log`, `auditd`, `osquery`)  
- Built-in endpoint protections (SIP, XProtect)  
- zsh automation (JSON + HTML output)  
- Configuration Profiles (MDM simulation)  
- Local incident response triage  

Each lab folder contains a `README.md`, `artifacts/`, and `images/` directory with step-by-step instructions, screenshots, and results.
